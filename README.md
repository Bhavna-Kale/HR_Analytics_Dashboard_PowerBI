## üí° Project Goal

This project is a high-impact **Human Resources (HR) Analytics Dashboard** designed to transform raw employee data into **strategic business intelligence**. The core objective is to provide HR managers and business leaders with a clear, visual tool to monitor the health of the workforce, understand talent dynamics, and proactively address issues like employee turnover.

## ‚ú® Key Features & Analytical Metrics

The dashboard provides comprehensive monitoring and deep-dive analysis on the following key areas:

* **Attrition Analysis:** Tracks the **Attrition Rate** (or **Turnover Rate**) over time, identifying which departments, job roles, or demographics are experiencing the highest churn.
* **Headcount Management:** Provides a current snapshot of **Total Headcount** and analyzes trends in hiring and termination over time.
* **Demographic Insights:** Visualizes employee distribution across critical dimensions like **Department, Job Role, Education, and Age**, helping to assess workforce diversity and balance.
* **Operational KPIs:** Measures key performance indicators (KPIs) such as **Average Years at Company** and **Monthly Income Distribution** to evaluate employee stability and compensation fairness.
* **Data Modeling:** Established a robust data model within the BI tool (Power BI/Tableau) and utilized custom calculations (**DAX** or equivalent) for accurate metric calculation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tool & Technology

* **Primary Tool:** **Power BI / Tableau** (Specify the tool you used)
* **Skills Demonstrated:** Data Modeling, DAX/Custom Calculations, Data Transformation (Power Query/ETL), and Interactive Visualization.
